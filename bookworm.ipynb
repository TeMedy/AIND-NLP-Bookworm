    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will build a simple question-answering agent that is able to learn from any text data you provide, and answer queries posed in natural language. You will use IBM Watson's cloud-based services to process the input text data and find relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this project, you will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a cloud-based NLP service instance and configure it.\n",
    "- Ingest a set of text documents using the service and analyze the results.\n",
    "- Accept questions in natural language and parse them.\n",
    "- Find relevant answers from the preprocessed text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use Watson's cloud-based services, you first need to create an account on the [IBM Bluemix platform](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/).\n",

Note that Watson treats each \"document\" as a unit of text that is returned as the result of a query. But we want to retrieve a paragraph of text for each question. So, let's split each file up into individual paragraphs. We will use the [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) library for this purpose.\n",

    "_**Note**: You could also add and manage documents in the collection using the Discovery tool, but you would have to split paragraphs up into separate files._\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Note**: We have provided a set of files (`data/Star-Wars/*.html`) with summary plots for Star Wars movies, but you are free to use a collection of your choice. Open one of the files in a text editor to see how the paragraphs are delimited using `<p>...</p>` tags - this is how the code block below split paragraphs into separate \"documents\"._"

    "## 3. Parse natural language questions\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand questions posed in natural language, we'll use another Watson service called [Conversation](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/conversation/index.html). It can be used to design conversational agents or _chatbots_ that exhibit complex behavior, but for the purpose of this project, we'll only use it to parse certain kinds of queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a Conversation service instance\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like you did for the Discovery service, create an instance of the Conversation service. Then launch the associated tool from the service dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/conversation-tooling.png\" alt=\"Conversation service - Tool homepage\" width=\"800\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "A _workspace_ allows you to keep all the items you need for a particular application in one place, just like an _environment_ in case of the Discovery service. Create one called \"Bookworm\" with a suitable description, such as \"I know a lot of stories. Ask me a question!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/conversation-workspace.png\" alt=\"Conversation service - Blank workspace\" width=\"800\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "This should open up a blank workspace, where you can add intents, define the entities you want the agent to idenitfy and structure the overall dialog.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add intents\n",
    "\n",
    "An _intent_ is the goal or purpose of a user's input. Create a set of intents (at least 3) that capture the different kinds of questions that you want the system to answer, e.g. _who_, _what_ and _where_. Along with each intent, add a list of user examples or _utterances_ that map to that intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, you could enter the following examples for the _where_ intent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Where is the Jedi temple located?\n",
    "- Where was Luke born?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Conversation service recommends at least 5 examples for each intent so that Watson learns how to recognize it. These don't have to be very precise, but more examples the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/conversation-intents.png\" alt=\"Conversation service - Intents listed\" width=\"800\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to create your own intents, based on the kinds of questions you want the system to answer, e.g. \"How many ...\", \"What are the most common ...\" etc. Each intent will need to be mapped to an appropriate query.\n",
    "\n",
    "> See [**Defining intents**](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/conversation/intents.html) for a helpful video and further instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q**: What intents did you add to the Conversation service instance?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A**:\n",
    "where, who, what \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q**: Pick one of these intents, and list at least 5 examples for the intent that you entered.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A**:\n",
    "  - Who destroyed the planet?\n",
    "  - Who is Luke?\n",
    "  - Who is princess Lia?\n",
    "  - who started the war?\n",
    "  - who are the main characters in star wars?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add entities\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your intents set, let's tell the service what entities we want it to identify. One way to do this is using the tool interface, and entering them one-by-one.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Go to [**Defining entities**](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/conversation/entities.html) to see how that is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that can be tedious! So let's refer back to the entities that the Discovery service identified, and load them in programmatically.\n",
    "\n",

    "The IBM Watson can quickly extract a lot of information within a document such as sentiment, places, people, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some pros and cons of this service: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros:\n",
    " - It can run very fast. \n",
    " - It is easy to get up and running, and see some results. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons: \n",
    " - Not customizable: since the frame work is meant to be a service to general consumer, it can only perform tasks that it is designed for. Therefore, it is not suitable for research or trying out new ideas. \n",
    " - The a query is performed in a document, the results are hard to work with. The final answer basically needs to be handcrafted.\n",

    "We have provided a set of sample data files containing Star Wars plot summaries. But as mentioned before, you are free to use your own dataset. In fact, a larger dataset maybe more suitable for use with IBM Watson's NLP services. If you used your own dataset, answer the following questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q**: What dataset did you use, and in what ways is it different from the sample files provided?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q**: Either include your dataset in the .zip file or repository you submit, or provide clear instructions on how to obtain the dataset, so that your reviewer can run your notebook or inspect the data to verify your results.\n",
